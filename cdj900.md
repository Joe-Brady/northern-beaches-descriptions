The CDJ-900 accompanies the launch of the new range-topping CDJ-2000 player and is loaded with many shared features.

It can play from various different music sources, including CD and USB storage devices.

It also comes with the revolutionary music database management software for DJs: rekordbox™. Based on our Prepare & Perform’ concept, rekordbox works (for both Mac and PC) like the leading music database management software, but is more creative and more DJ-friendly.

rekordbox allows DJs to prepare more before their performance and opens a door to tools such as Quantize for perfectly synced loops every time.

DJs can then export data to a USB device to access vast libraries of music files and perform live – without the need for extra equipment or any inconvenient rewiring in the club.
