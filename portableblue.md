Use the extremely lightweight, yet powerful EUROPORT iP40 PA system to stream songs from your Bluetooth-enabled iOS device at the next company picnic, or to get your message across on the playing field. With its 40-Watt amplifier and premium 2-way speaker system, the iP40 provides superb sound—and the rechargeable battery lasts up to 12 hours. Add one or two of our ULM digital microphones, and you’ve got a supremely easy-to-use wireless, go-anywhere sound system on wheels.

The days of tape decks, CD players and even MP3 devices are long gone. Now your music lives on your phone or computer tablet, so you can stop searching for those outdated cables and fancy adapters. Now with a simple wave of your hand, you can stream music from any Bluetooth audio-equipped device such as your iPad, iPod touch, iPhone, even your laptop computer.

The MPA40BT-Pro features built-in 2-channel mixer with the same ultra-low noise, high-headroom mic preamps that have made BEHRINGER mixers legendary. Also included is 2-band equaliser, plus Bluetooth for streaming audio directly from your iOS device, and our proprietary ULM wireless technology.
