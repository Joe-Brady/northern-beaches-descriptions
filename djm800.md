The new DJM-800 incorporates features recommended by many professional DJs and club engineers, raising the bar on sound fidelity and ease of mixer operation. Most important are its high quality 24bit/96kHz sampling and effect capabilities.

High Quality Audio The analogue signal from the player passes through the shortest signal route, first digitized at 24bit/96kHz through a pro A/D converter where it reaches  the digital mixing stage with the best sound possible.

The mixing is carried out by 32bit DSP with minimal deterioration of sound quality.  A highly rigid chassis minimizes unnecessary vibration, which could adversely affect sound quality.
