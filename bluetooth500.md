These speakers are available in three versions the ‘d’, ‘mp3′ and ‘w’. What’s the difference? The Behringer Eurolive B112D / B115MP3 is just the regular PA speaker with the integrated mixers and wireless option. The Behringer Eurolive B112MP3 / B115MP3 is the same as the ‘d’ just adds in a USB slot which allows for the playback of mp3 music for the USB flash storage device. Behringer Eurolive B112W / B115W does not contain the mp3 option but adds a High-performance Bluetooth technology to stream audio wirelessly from any Bluetooth-compatible device like your smart phone or tablet.
